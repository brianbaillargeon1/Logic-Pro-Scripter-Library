# Logic-Pro-Scripter-Library
Logic Pro has a powerful MIDI FX plugin called 'Scripter' in which you can manipulate MIDI with Javascript. This is a compilation of such Javascript to share with Logic Pro producers.

# Usage
On an instrument track in Logic Pro, go to MIDI FX > Scripter > Open Script in Editor, then paste the contents of whichever file suits your production. Each file may contain additional instructions.
